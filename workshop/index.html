    <h1>VizWiz Workshop</h1>
    <p class="lead">Visual Question Answering with Impact</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We propose the first workshop challenge in the artificial intelligence community on data originating from blind people in order to
encourage a larger community to collaborate on developing algorithms for assistive technologies. Our challenge is designed
around a new visual question answering (VQA) dataset that consists of visual questions asked by blind people, who each took a
picture using a mobile phone and recorded a spoken question, together with 10 crowdsourced answers. These visual questions
came from over 11,000 blind people in real足world scenarios where the people were seeking to learn about the physical world
around themselves. Our challenge addresses two tasks: (1) visual question answering and (2) predicting if a visual question is
answerable. We hope this challenge will educate more people about the technological needs of blind people while providing an
exciting new opportunity for researchers to develop assistive technologies that eliminate accessibility barriers for blind people.
</p>
<p>
More broadly, this workshop will promote greater interaction between the diversity of researchers and practitioners interested in
developing accessible VQA technology. To foster a discussion of current research and application issues, we invited speakers
from both academia and industry to share about their experiences in building today's state-足of-the-足art assistive technologies as well as designing next generation tools. We hope for this workshop to connect the appropriate people in order to accelerate the conversion of cutting edge research into market products that assist blind people to overcome their daily visual challenges.

<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>
We invite two types of submissions:
</p>

<!--<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0">-->
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Challenge Submissions</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
We invite submissions of results from a single algorithm for each of the two challenge tasks.  All information about both challenges and the submission process can be found <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">at this link??<a?.  We accept submissions for algorithms that are not published, currently under review, and already published.  The teams with the top-performing submissions will be invited to give short talks during the workshop.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Extended Abstracts</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
We invite submissions of extended abstracts on topics related to visual question answering and assistive technologies for blind people.  Papers must be at most two pages (with references) and follow the ECCV formatting guidelines using the provided author kit.  Reviewing will be single-blind and accepted papers will be presented as posters.  We accept submissions on work that is not published, currently under review, and already published.  There will be no proceedings.  Please send your extended abstracts to <a href="mailto:workshop@vizwiz.org">workshop@vizwiz.org</a>.
